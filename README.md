Program handles common misspellings.
Minimalist design (a-la notepad), the program searches for variants of entered word, (based on the coincidence of the already entered letters with prefixes of words in the dictionary), and offers them in a list of strings under cursor. The algorithm treats common misspellings: confused letters, incorrect doubling of consonants, etc. Word is choosed by arrow keys, choise is accepted by Tab or Return.
